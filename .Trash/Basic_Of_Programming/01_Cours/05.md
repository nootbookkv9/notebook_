# CPU Speed --------------------------------------------
# Hertx HZ -> Cycles per second (Clock Cycle)

# 32 Bit
## Less processing power, older, slower, and less secure.
## 2**32 = 4,294,967,296 Byts
## Can allocate only 4GB of memory (RAM)
## Referred to as x86 or x86-32
## Can only run a 32-bit operating system and 32-bit software

# 64 Bit
## More processing power, newer, faster, and more secure.
## 2**64 = 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 Byte
## Can allocat much more RAM
## Referred to as x64 or x86-64
## Can run both 64-bit and 32-bit operating systems and software
