# Byte Parts:
## 1 Nibble		--> Nibble is a group of 4 bits together || Or Half Byte
## 1 Crumb		--> Crumb  is a group of 2 bits together

## First	Bit	--> LSB --> Lowest Significant Bit
## Last		Bit	--> MSB --> Most Significant Bit
## First 4	Bit --> Lower Nibble
## Last 4	Bit --> Upper Nibble

## 1 Byte		==> 8 Bit
## 1 Byte		==> 2 Nibble
## 1 Byte		==> 4 Crumb

## 1 Nibble		==> 4 Bit
## 1 Nibble		==> 2 Crumb

## 1 Crumb		==> 2 Bit



# Homework

# 1 -> What is Bit?
## Bit is a one signal 0 or 1

# 2 -> What is Crumb?
## Crumb is 2 Bits

# 3 -> What is Nibble?
## Nibble is 4 Bits or 2 Crumb or Half Byte

# 4 -> What is Byte?
## Byte is 8 Bit or 4 Crumb or 2 Nibble

# 5 -> How many bits in a byte?
## We have 8 Bits in 1 Byte

# 6 -> How many crumbs in a byte?
## We have 4 Crumbs in 1 Byte

# 7 -> How many nibbles in a byte?
## We have 2 Nibbles in 1 Byte

# 8 -> How many crumbs in a nibble?
## We have 2 Crumbs in 1 Nibble

# 9 -> What is the lower nibble?
## The lower nibble is first 4 bits

# 10 -> What is the upper nibble?
## The upper Nibble is Last 4 bits

# 11 -> What is LSB? And why we call it LSB? What it's value?
## The LSB is fist bit in 8 bits
## LSB Mean --> Lowest Significant Bit 
## It's value = 2 Power 0 or 2^0

# 12 -> What is MSB/ And why we call it MSB? What it's Value?
## The MSB is last bit in 8 bits
## MSB Mean --> Most Significant Bit
## It's value = 2 Power 7 or 2^7
