Insert a Node after a Given Node in Linked List

If we want to insert a new node after a specific node, we first locate that node. Once we find it, we set the new node’s next reference to point to the node that follows the given node. Then, we update the given node’s next to point to the new node. This requires traversing the list to find the specified node.
