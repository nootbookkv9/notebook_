Insert a Node At a Specific Position in Linked List

To insert a new node at a specific position, we need to traverse the list to position â€“ 1. If the position is valid, we adjust the pointers similarly such that the next pointer of the new node points to the next of current nod and next pointer of current node points to the new node.
