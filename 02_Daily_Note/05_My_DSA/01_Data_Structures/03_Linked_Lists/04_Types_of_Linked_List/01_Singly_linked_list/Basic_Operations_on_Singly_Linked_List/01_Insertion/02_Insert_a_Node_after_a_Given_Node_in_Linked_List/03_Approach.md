Approach: 

    Initialize a pointer curr to traverse the list starting from head.
    Loop through the list to find the node with data equal to key.
        If not found then return from function.
    Create a new node, say new_node initialized with the given data.
    Make the next pointer of new_node as next of given node.
    Update the next pointer of given node point to the new_node.
