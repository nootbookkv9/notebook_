Deletion at Middle of the Linked List

Deletion at middle refers to deleting a node that is neither the first nor the last node in the linked list.

    To delete a node in the middle, we must first traverse the list to find the node just before the one we want to delete. Then, adjust the pointers to bypass the node being deleted.
