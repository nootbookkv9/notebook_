Deletion at the End of Linked List

Deletion at the end operation involves removing the last node of the linked list.

    To perform the deletion at the end of Linked List, we need to traverse the list to find the second last node, then set its next pointer to null. If the list is empty then there is no node to delete or has only one node then point head to null.
