Traversal of Singly Linked List (Recursive Approach)

We can also traverse the singly linked list using recursion. We start at the head node of the singly linked list, check if it is null or not and print its value. We then call the traversal function again with the next node passed as pointer.

Step-by-Step Algorithm

        Firstly, we define a recursive method to traverse the singly linked list, which takes a node as a parameter.
        In this function, the base case is that if the node is null then we will return from the recursive method.
        We then pass the head node as the parameter to this function.
        After that, we access and print the data of the current node.
        At last, we will make a recursive call to this function with the next node as the parameter.
