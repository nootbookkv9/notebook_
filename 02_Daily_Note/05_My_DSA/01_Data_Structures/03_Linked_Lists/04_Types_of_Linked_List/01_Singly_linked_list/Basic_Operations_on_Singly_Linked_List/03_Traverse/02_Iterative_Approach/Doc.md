Traversal of Singly Linked List (Iterative Approach)

The process of traversing a singly linked list involves printing the value of each node and then going on to the next node and print that nodeâ€™s value also and so on, till we reach the last node in the singly linked list, whose next node points towards the null.

Step-by-Step Algorithm

        We will initialize a temporary pointer to the head node of the singly linked list.
        After that, we will check if that pointer is null or not null, if it is null, then return.
        While the pointer is not null, we will access and print the data of the current node, then we move the pointer to next node.
