Doubly Linked List:

Doubly Linked List is a type of linked list where each node has three parts: data, next pointer and previous pointer. The data part stores the information, the next pointer points to the next node of the linked list and the previous pointer points to the previous node of the linked list. The next pointer of the last node and the previous pointer of the first node stores null. Traversal of items can be done in the forward direction as well as backward direction due to the linking of every node to its next node as well as the previous node.
