What is a Linked List?
Linked List is a linear data structure which looks like a series of nodes, where each node has two parts: data and next pointer. Unlike Arrays, Linked List elements are not stored at a contiguous location. In the linked list there is a head pointer, which points to the first element of the linked list, and if the list is empty then it simply points to null or nothing.
