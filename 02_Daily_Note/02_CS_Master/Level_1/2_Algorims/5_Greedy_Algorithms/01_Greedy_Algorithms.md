# Greedy Algorithms ##########################################
What is Greedy Algorithms ?
  - Algorithms Paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece
  - Always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit
  - Greedy Algorithms are used for optimization problems
  - At every step, we can make a choice that looks best at the moment, and we get the optimal solution of the complete problem
