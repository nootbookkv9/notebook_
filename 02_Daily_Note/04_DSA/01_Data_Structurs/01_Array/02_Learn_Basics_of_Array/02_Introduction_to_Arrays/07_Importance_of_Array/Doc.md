# Importance of Array

Assume there is a class of five students and 
if we have to keep records of their marks 
in examination then, we can do this by 
declaring five variables individual and 
keeping track of records but what if the 
number of students becomes very large,
it would be challenging to manipulate and 
maintain the data.

What it means is that, 
we can use normal variables (v1, v2, v3, ..) 
when we have a small number of objects. 
But if we want to store a large number of 
instances, 
it becomes difficult to manage them with 
normal variables.

The idea of an array is to represent many 
instances in one variable.
