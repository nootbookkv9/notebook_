# Fixed Sized Arrays: 

We cannot alter or update the size of this array. 
Here only a fixed size 
(i,e. the size that is mentioned in square brackets []) 
of memory will be allocated for storage.

In case, we don’t know the size of the array then 
if we declare a larger size and store a lesser number of 
elements will result in a wastage of memory or 
we declare a lesser size than the number of elements then 
we won’t get enough memory to store all the elements.

In such cases, static memory allocation is not preferred.
