Disadvantages of Array

    As arrays have a fixed size, once the memory is allocated to them, it cannot be increased or decreased, making it impossible to store extra data if required. An array of fixed size is referred to as a static array. 
    Allocating less memory than required to an array leads to loss of data.
    An array is homogeneous in nature so, a single array cannot store values of different data types. 
    Arrays store data in contiguous memory locations, which makes deletion and insertion very difficult to implement. This problem is overcome by implementing linked lists, which allow elements to be accessed sequentially.
