Conclusion

After the discussion, we concluded that arrays are 
a simple method of accessing elements of the same 
type by grouping them and we can find the elements 
efficiently by their indexes and can perform different 
operations using them. Thus, they are more efficient 
when it comes to memory allocation and should be used in 
all modern programming languages. So, this becomes a 
favorite topic for the perspective of the interview and 
most of the companies generally asked about the problems on 
the array. For all these reasons, we must have a good 
knowledge of it.
