Applications of Array in Java:

    Storing collections of data: Arrays are often used to store collections of data of the same type. For example, an array of integers can be used to store a set of numerical values.
    Implementing matrices and tables: Arrays can be used to implement matrices and tables. For example, a two-dimensional array can be used to store a matrix of numerical values.
    Sorting and searching: Arrays are often used for sorting and searching data. For example, the Arrays class in Java provides methods like sort() and binarySearch() to sort and search elements in an array.
    Implementing data structures: Arrays are used as the underlying data structure for several other data structures like stacks, queues, and heaps. For example, an array-based implementation of a stack can be used to store elements in the stack.
    Image processing: Arrays are commonly used to store the pixel values of an image. For example, a two-dimensional array can be used to store the RGB values of an image.
