Applications of Array in C/C++:

    Arrays are used to implement vectors, and lists in C++ STL.
    Arrays are used as the base of all sorting algorithms.
    Arrays are used to implement other DS like a stack, queue, etc.
    Used for implementing matrices. 
    Data structures like trees also sometimes use the array implementation since arrays are easier to handle than pointers. For example, a segment tree uses array implementation.
    Binary search trees and balanced binary trees are used in data structures such as a heap, map, and set, which can be built using arrays.
    Graphs are also implemented as arrays in the form of an adjacency matrix.
