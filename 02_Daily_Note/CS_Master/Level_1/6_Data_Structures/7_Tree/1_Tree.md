# Tree #######################################################
# Linear VS Non Linear DS ####################################
  - Linear DS
    - Elements are stored in one line
    - Youcan determine the position of any element
  - Non Linear DS
    - Elements are stored in random relation
    - You can not determine the position of any element

# Tree Definitions
Root        --> First node in the tree
                - node 0
Child       --> Branch of node
                - 1,2,3 are children of 0
Parent      --> What branched from
                - 1 is parent for 4,5
Ancestors   --> Parents to Root
Leaves      --> Nodes has no Children
Sub-Tree    --> Part of tree makes tree
Height      --> Number of Levels
                - 2
Depth       --> Number of levels from node to root
                - Depth(1) = 1
