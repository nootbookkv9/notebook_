# Queue ######################################################
  --> Linear Data Structure in which data is stored one after other
  --> Added element goes to back (rear)
  --> Take the first element (front)
  --> First-in-First-out (FIFO)

# Queue Implementation
  [1] Using Array
  [2] Using Linked List
  [3] Using Stack

# Queue Properties and Methodes
  Front       --> The first element in the Queue
  Rear        --> The last element in the Queue
  Enqueue(e)  --> Add element to the Queue
  Dequeue()   --> Remove element from the Queue


# Type of another (Queue) ########################
# Circular Queue
  --> The front is read and go back to the rear
  --> Ring Buffer

# Priority Queue
  --> Each element has a priority
  --> We take the element that has the highest priority


# Queue Applications #############################
  --> Implement many algorithms and data structures
  --> Operatin Systems
