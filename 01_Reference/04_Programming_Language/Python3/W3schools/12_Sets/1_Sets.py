# Sets ========================================
""" Note: Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.  """

# ---------------------------------------------
# Create a Set:

thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(thisset)

# Note: the set list is unordered, meaning: the items will appear in a random order.
# Refresh this page to see the change in the result.

""" Out: 
{'apple', 'cherry', 'banana'}
"""

""" Note: Sets are unordered, so you cannot be sure in which order the items will appear.  """
