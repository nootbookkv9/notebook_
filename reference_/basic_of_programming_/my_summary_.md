# Remove negative people from your life
# take your time
# Don't waste your time in the wrong place
	There are many wrong ways to learn programming
	How to learn programming the right way
		1 -> Understand what programming is
			- Learning programming is not a programming language	
				Programming language is part of learning programming
			- Programming is a new way of thinking
				To teach a computer how to think, you must know how to think
					who doesn't have thing cannot gave it
				Learn logical way of thinking			
					Thinking must be specific
					True thing and false thing
					Correct evidence method
						100% correct idea
							Evidence	= 100% correct idea
							Argument	< 100% correct idea
						Introductions and conclusion
							There must be at least two premises
							There can be hidden introductions
							There can be a tree of premises and conclusions
							You must make sure that The introductions must be verified
							You must make sure that the premises are linked to the conclusio				
				Logical fallacies

		2 -> you have to learn basics of programming
			Don't learn modern programming languages
			Don't be mouse developer
			Solve 2000 challenges		
				C++ Labs
			Learn programming lenguage and DataBase

# Date & Information & Knowledge & Wisdom 
# What is the difference between "Data" and "Information"
##	Data --> Process --> Information
	Data		= Date
	Process		= Structure it --> Organize it --> Analyze it --> Gave it meaning
	Information	= Data + Meaning

##  Data						  vs	Information
	Raw facs							Driven from data
	Unstructured and Unorganized		Structured and Organized
	Unanalyzed							Analyzed
	Unprocessed							Processed
	Has no meaning						Has meaning


# What is "Knowledge"
## Many information with time	--> Knowledge
# What is "Wisdom"
## Applied Knowledge			--> Wisdom

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What is Computer
## The Computer is a Electronic Device.
## Inputs --> Processing --> Outputs
## Hardware & Software

# Functionalities Of Computer
## 1 -> Input Date

# ASCII
## American Standard Code for Information Interchange
## Supports specific characters (less space)
## Has 2 standards:
###		7-bit ASCII - 128 characters
###		8-bit ASCII - 256 characters
## Only one language

# UNICODE
## Universal Coding System
## Large number of charactes (large space)
## It has 3 statndards
###		UTF 8 - 256				characters 
###		UTF 8 - 65,536			characters
###		UTF 8 - 4,294,967,296	characters
## Any combination of languages

# Byte Parts:
## 1 Nibble		--> Nibble is a group of 4 bits together || Or Half Byte
## 1 Crumb		--> Crumb  is a group of 2 bits together

## First	Bit	--> LSB --> Lowest Significant Bit
## Last		Bit	--> MSB --> Most Significant Bit
## First 4	Bit --> Lower Nibble
## Last 4	Bit --> Upper Nibble

## 1 Byte		==> 8 Bit
## 1 Byte		==> 2 Nibble
## 1 Byte		==> 4 Crumb

## 1 Nibble		==> 4 Bit
## 1 Nibble		==> 2 Crumb

## 1 Crumb		==> 2 Bit


# CPU Speed --------------------------------------------
# Hertx HZ -> Cycles per second (Clock Cycle)

# 32 Bit
## Less processing power, older, slower, and less secure.
## 2**32 = 4,294,967,296 Byts
## Can allocate only 4GB of memory (RAM)
## Referred to as x86 or x86-32
## Can only run a 32-bit operating system and 32-bit software

# 64 Bit
## More processing power, newer, faster, and more secure.
## 2**64 = 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 Byte
## Can allocat much more RAM
## Referred to as x64 or x86-64
## Can run both 64-bit and 32-bit operating systems and software

# What is Network?
## Network is a group of connected cuputer and devices.
### For example, the computers, phones, and other devices that your family owns aor all part of your home computer network.
### When you get a new tablt and enter in the Wi-Fi password, you're joining that tablet to your home computer network.

# Why do we need Network?
## Devices in the same network can easily communicate and share resources with each other.
## For example : you can control your TV with your mobile, or you can stream videos from your mobile to your TV.

# Network Types
## 1 -> LAN : Local area Network
### LAN : Local Area Network that has a group of connected devices.
		LAN is a type of network made up of nearby computers.
		A LAN can have anywhere from a few devices (like a home network) to hundreds of devices (like a school or hospital)
		Large organizations like colleges can have multiple LANs - maybe one per building.
## 2 -> WAN : Wide Area Network
		WAN is made of connected LANs that are far from each other (like in different parts of the country or world).
		WANs connect thousands oreven milions of devices.

# Connection Types
## 1 -> Wired : Using wires or cabes With Ethernet
### Communication Ways
		Switch : Ethernet 
			Rules that computers follow for communicating on a wired network
## 2 -> Wireless : Without weres using Wi-Fi
### Communication Ways
		Router : Wireless
			Rules that computers follow for communicating through a radio signals
				Wi-Fi is a popular way to connect wirelessly to a network
				Wi-Fi --> Wirelwss Fidelity

# Protocol
## Protocol is a standard set of rules for how devices communicate through wires or wireless

# Programming language history

# Translator Software
## Compiler
## Interpreter


Source Code		--> print("Hi");
Object Code		--> 0101001 ...

# Level of languages
## 0 -> Hardwars
## 1 -> Binary code
## 2 -> Lowet Level Machine Language :
	Hexadecimal/Binary Instructions
## 3 -> Low Level Languages :
	Assembly
## 4 -> Middle Level Languages :
	C & C++
## 5 -> High Level Languages :
	Java, C#, VB, etc.
## 6 -> Scripting & Interpreted Languages :
	Python, JavaScript

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Compiler :
## Source code		--> Print("Hi");
## Compiler			--> Build
## Object code		--> Linker (Object code & Libraries) --> (.exe file) --> Loader (load to RAM) 

# How Compiler works
	Scan Entire program
	Searche Errors
		Display Errors Message
			Stop
		Output Object Code

# How Interpreter works
	Read one instruction at a time
	Searche Errors
		Display Error Message
			Stop
		Output Machine Code

# Assembler
## Assembler is the program that translate the assembly code to machine code.
